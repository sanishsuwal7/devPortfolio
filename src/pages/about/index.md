Hi, leaders! My name is Alejandro Aspinwall. I’m a software engineer based in Montreal Canada 🇨🇦 I have worked in the entertainment industry and media for 15 years. My most recent role was as the lead technology researcher at Playhybrid, where I was working on creating Augmented Reality experiences for Facebook.

My industry experience has taught me the **power of storytelling** and the important role it plays for brands. I’m currently a Business Technology Consultant working with stakeholders to improve their value proposition in the digital space.

**I have been building web stuff since I was 11 years-old**. Back in the day I tinkered endlessly with the site builder tool from Geocities and came up with a few sites where I could host the Flash animations I was making for my friends. Later, the game changed and the cool stuff was made with Dreamweaver, so I used it to make fan-club websites for my favourite musicians. When social media came around **I was making myspace websites look stunning** (14 year old me thought so) with my sick html / css skills.

**Since then I haven't stopped learning and creating.** I have been involved in music, photography, sound engineering, electronic engineering, programming, video production, feature film post-production, VR games, and 3D sound.

In the last few years, I have been increasingly working on software development in my professional life. I've been lucky to have worked alongside senior developers and designers, who have taught me what's expected from a quality product.

###As a developer

I pay close **attention to my code’s readability**. Sure, I’ll put together something as quickly as possible to make it work, but after that I’ll spend a good amount of time commenting and organizing everything. _Mi casa es tu casa_, I want you to **feel welcome around my code.**

**Clean, consistent, readable and maintainable code.** It’s great when features work, but it’s even greater whenever they can stay that way, regardless of who’s working on them.

I’m excited to work on new projects, because **I learn something new every time**. I’m excited for the next challenge!

###As a person

If I had to describe myself in one word, it would be **resourceful**. I’ll take a problem, break it into smaller bits and MacGyver myself a solution. Creativity has helped me sail around tough obstacles.

**I’m curious by nature and I love learning**. I’ve amassed a wide range of skills and interests that when put together, end up feeding my career in one way or another. I’m what they call a <span id='tshaped'>T-shaped individual</span>.

###As a colleague
**I’m a team player**, with my background in engineering and art, I feel comfortable interacting with both the **technically oriented** people of the team as well as the **artistically oriented** ones. I will always go the extra mile to help my team.

My communications skills are excellent. I’ve worked on the side as a teacher for ten years. This experience has made me feel **comfortable at conveying ideas in creative ways so that everyone can understand them**.

My experience working for a small startup gave me exposure to the business side of a tech company, while at the same time delivering industry standard results on the production side. **I have lead projects where we collaborated directly with Facebook and Amazon.**

I’m always happy to pull an **espresso shot** and make some latte art for a colleague. **I love to cook**, so be on the lookout for the next potluck.

**I want to hear from you!**
