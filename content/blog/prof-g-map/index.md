This past week many of us have spent a **little too much time staring at maps**. An electoral map shows division by default. **I want to show you a map that shows quite the opposite.**

[On my previous post](https://aaspinwall.com/profg), I concluded that **positivity and optimism** was a major commonality in the sprint's community. Knowing that **so many people from all over the world are collaborating and sharing ideas**, made me want to know a little more about the cohort.

I have to admit that I'm a sucker for maps. They give me a feeling of **endless possibilities**. I also love traveling, but that's something that I haven't been able to do this year. Strangely enough, **working on this map gave me a feeling of discovery**. I've spent a bit too long playing around with it. I'm picturing each one of us, **peeking out the window and looking at something completely different**. My imagination flies! But enough said, here it is. I hope you enjoy it as much as I do.

### The process

**Nerd talk ahead:**

I took the location data from the Sprint Directory and formatted so that each entry would look like this:

_Austin, TX / London, UK / Sydney, Australia_

I ran these locations through the Google Maps API to get coordinates. Finally, the anonymized data was plotted on the map using a Python library called folium.

It's been a challenging year but being part of Prof G's sprint has been one of the most pleasant surprises of 2020. I know you're all busy working on our final projects, it's a lot of work! But **I hope this map gives you a nice feeling of closeness as it did to me**. We're all in this together!

-Alejandro

PS I want to thank my colleague **Javier Vazquez** for helping me plot the data on the map. He's an awesome data scientist!
