![a warm note to say](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17233773/98298339-d7679a00-1f83-11eb-8032-5b90207abd92.png)

### What are we building?

It's a **food tracker web-app** that helps people find what they're allergic to... But Gamified!

### Who is it for?

We're looking for developers who are interested in practicing and improving their skills. It doesn't matter how long you've been coding for, there's a place for you.

Other skilled people are welcome as well, designers, UI, UX, writers, translators project managers, you name it!

### What's in it for you?

Hit the ground running with an open source project under your belt. Show the world what you can do!
Make connections and network: The world is full with awesome people who want to help out.
Teamwork: This is an open source project, anybody can help with as little or as much as they like.

### Tools we'll be using

Next.js for the frontend
Vercel for deployment
Github for source control
The rest will be determined by the team as we go

### Not sure if you're qualified?

_"I just started coding and I only new a bit of HTML and CSS"_

That's awesome! We need help with styling, we want it to look beautiful!

_"I'm new to React and I don't know anything about Next.js"_

That's great! Next uses regular React components. You should be up and running in no time!

### Motivation

If you've ever had food allergies or met anybody who suffers from that, you know how hard it can be. Trying to figure out what's wrong with your body is exhausting. It usually takes years to find that pesky food that's making you sick. That usually means filling out one of these:

We want to simplify that process with an app that lets you take pictures of your food and keep track of your symptoms throughout the day. The idea is to make it fast and simple. Take the picture, swipe and tap a few times and you're done!
The alternatives out there are paid apps with a ton of features that you don't need.

As creators we have the power to help others with the tools at our disposal. Doing that while getting real world experience is twice as rewarding.
