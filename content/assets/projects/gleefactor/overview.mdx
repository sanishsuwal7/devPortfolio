# Project Purpose and Goal

Gleefactor is a work culture management firm that helps organizations transform their cultures by enabling teams to adopt and activate new behaviours through play. **The goal was to create a fast website that would drive conversions** from social media and search engine traffic.

The company had to pivot away from in-person events and quickly build an online platform that would be able to handle a growing number of uniquely built products. This posed a challenge for their Wordpress based infrastructure.

# Web Stack and Explanation

I chose a server side rendered site that would load from a CDN to achieve the fastest loading times. **I chose Gatsby for the static page generation because their Wordpress plugin is second to none.**

**I intended to keep Wordpress as a headless CMS to ensure that any changes to the content would trigger a new site build**. The data would then be fetched from WP and rendered as HTML.

This project uses APIs that are commonly executed on a server but **I opted to use a serverless approach by creating Lambda functions that run on demand**. Luckily lambda functions are built into the Gatsby/Netlify architecture. All the sensitive data is kept safe using environment variables.

**I deployed the site to Netlify** because I am very comfortable with the tools they provide for continuous deployment and integration.

# Problems and Thought Process

**I was initially brought into the project to maintain the website running solely on Wordpress.** Unfortunately, there had been many iterations of the site built on top of each other without proper maintenance. **In practical terms, this meant that the plugins that were used years ago, couldn't be updated to keep compatibility with other plugins that kept the core functionalities stable.** All this resulted in a slow, insecure, hard-to-maintain site. We soon came to the conclusion that **re-building the site would be the best way to go forward.**

The client was happy with the site on Wordpress and requested it to stay there. To satisfy this, I re-organized all the content into pages and posts. Afterwards, **I mapped the data using GraphQL queries to build static pages.**

One of the biggest concerns for the client was administration costs and spam traffic. **To solve this problem, I opted to use serverless functions for the entire site**. This includes payments, emails and gated content.

Although the project's code is not available publicly, **here is a snippet that exemplifies how I implemented a lambda function that adds a subscriber to an email list.**

```javascript
const mailchimp = require("@mailchimp/mailchimp_marketing")

exports.handler = async function (event, context, callback) {
  const { email, firstName, lastName } = JSON.parse(event.body)
  try {
    const callChimp = async email => {
      const response = await mailchimp.lists.addListMember(listId, {
        email_address: email,
        status: "subscribed",
        merge_fields: {
          FNAME: firstName,
          LNAME: lastName,
        },
      })

      console.log(
        `Successfully added contact as an audience member. The contact's id is ${response.id}.`
      )
      //return response
      return Promise.resolve(response)
    }
    const chimpRes = await callChimp(email)
    return {
      statusCode: 200,
      body: JSON.stringify({
        response: `Successfully added contact as an audience member. The contact's id is ${chimpRes.id}.`,
        chimpRes,
      }),
    }
  } catch (error) {
    const {
      status,
      response: { text },
    } = error
    return {
      statusCode: status,
      body: JSON.stringify({
        response: `Something went wrong on Mailchimp's end`,
        text,
      }),
    }
  }
}
```

**This function is created on demand whenever a new user subscribes to the mailing list.** The API keys are stored using environment variables and are as safe as if they were running on an external server.

# Lessons Learned

I worked with WP many years ago, before I got into modern javascript based frameworks. I think the technology works very well for some organizations, especially ones that have a lot of content and not many features. **This project called for a flexible solution that would scale to fit the needs of the company's growth**. Moving the whole site away from WP would've been my choice but the client's requests made me re-evaluate the solutions. In the end, I'm very satisfied with the result!
