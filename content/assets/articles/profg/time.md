##Talk after lunch?

Intuitively, I thought that most people would take part in conversations sometime after lunch. I realized that **the cohort was composed of people from all over the world.** Lunchtime could be dinnertime for somebody else. After running the numbers, we can see that **the universal talk time for international business people is ~2pm Eastern Time.**
