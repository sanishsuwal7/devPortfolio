##Conclusion

I started the sprint wanting to learn about brand strategy. Right away, I came to realize that the community around the course would be just as important to the experience as the curriculum. At this point it's been a week since we started the sprint. So many interesting discussions have sparked on the Slack workplace that it's hard to keep up. But knowing that there's such a positive energy from the start makes me want to go even further. This year has been challenging for everyone, no doubt about it. But what I've learned from this analysis, makes me very hopeful for the future. I'm **excited** to be part of this **great** community of **creative** people, I want to learn more and I'd **love** to **help** as much as possible. I'll be talking to you after lunch 😉
